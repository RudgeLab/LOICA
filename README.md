As you may have noticed, our logo features a beautiful birdâ€”loica _[(Leistes loyca)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_meadowlark)_; a bird native to Chile known for its particular red chest and legendary kindness, with which we share name.

## Instalation

Installing LOICA is way easier than pronuncing it! Please refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/RudgeLab/LOICA/wiki) for installation instructions.

## LOICA allows you to:

- Compile Code into DNA fragments that execute Cell Algorithms
- Easy programation of genetic network models
- Generation of synthetic data
- Communicate with Flapjack
- Use and output SBOL files
- Use all sorts of cellular computation
- Easy, fluid and customisable DNA design

## Tutorials

Now that you have LOICA installed you can familiarize yourself with the tool using the [Jupyter notebook tutorials](https://github.com/RudgeLab/LOICA/tree/master/notebooks) designed for this purpose.
